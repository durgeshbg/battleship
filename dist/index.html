        <div class="rules-header">Battleship Game Rules</div>
        <p>Here are the rules for the web-based Battleship game:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Objective:</strong> Sink all of your opponent's ships before
            they sink yours.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Setup:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Each player has a gameboard to place their ships.</li>
              <li>
                Ships vary in length and are placed either horizontally or
                vertically on the grid.
              </li>
              <li>
                Players can manually place ships or use a random placement
                feature.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Gameplay:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Players take turns attacking the opponent's gameboard by
                selecting grid coordinates.
              </li>
              <li>
                If the attack hits a ship, the corresponding ship's
                <code>hit()</code> function is triggered.
              </li>
              <li>
                Missed shots are recorded on the gameboard and displayed
                visually.
              </li>
              <li>
                A ship is considered sunk when the number of hits equals its
                length.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Winning:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The game ends when all of one player's ships have been sunk.
              </li>
              <li>The first player to sink all their opponent's ships wins.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Features:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The computer opponent can make random legal moves to attack the
                player's gameboard.
              </li>
              <li>
                The game alternates turns between the player and the computer
                until a winner is determined.
              </li>
              <li>
                Gameboards display both hits and missed shots for easy tracking.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Implementation Notes:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Ships are objects with properties for length, hits, and a
                function to check if they are sunk.
              </li>
              <li>
                The gameboard manages ship placement, tracks attacks, and
                reports the game state.
              </li>
              <li>
                Event listeners handle user actions like placing ships and
                attacking coordinates.
              </li>
              <li>
                Game logic is tested through unit tests rather than relying on
                the DOM during development.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
